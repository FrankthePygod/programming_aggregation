# programming aggregation

### Goal

create a website with backend capacity, horning my frontend and backend skills.

## 12-09-2018 Update:

starting to gather resources and think about the modules in order to build the website and backends.

I woud like the website to be able to auto-generate code per request, send notification when jobs finish and auto-generate excel report at the end of each job to pass to teammates.

the start can be the backend where I store each individual code snippet into different small files and just call them as functions within a python package. 

before that, maybe learning the basics of building a python package should be the first step so that i can use the steps
